# Bank-Demo
This code contains a bank system with a DAO layer, DTOs, services, and a model. 
The code allows for the creation and management of bank accounts, withdrawl and deposit money , and checking account balances.
It replies to loan requests as well.
To simplify the initial development, an array list is used in the DAO layer instead of connecting to a database.
