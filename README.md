# Bank-Demo
This GitHub code contains a bank system with a DAO layer, DTOs, services, 
and a model. The code allows for the creation and management of bank accounts, 
transferring funds, and checking account balances. To simplify the initial development, 
an array list is used in the DAO layer instead of connecting to a database.
